- **Models**: Represent database entities and relationships
- **Migrations**: Define database schema and structure
- **Middleware**: Handle request filtering and authentication
- **Services**: Contain business logic and complex operations

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Components**: Built with TypeScript for type safety
- **Inertia.js**: Bridges Laravel and React seamlessly
